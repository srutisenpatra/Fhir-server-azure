# Fhir-server-azure
FHIR Server for Azure is an open-source implementation of the emerging HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification designed for the Microsoft cloud. The FHIR specification defines how clinical health data can be made interoperable across systems, and the FHIR Server for Azure helps facilitate that interoperability in the cloud. The goal of this Microsoft Healthcare project is to enable developers to rapidly deploy a FHIR service.

With data in the FHIR format, the FHIR Server for Azure enables developers to quickly ingest and manage FHIR datasets in the cloud, track and manage data access and normalize data for machine learning workloads. FHIR Server for Azure is optimized for the Azure ecosystem:

1. Scripts and ARM templates are available for immediate provisioning in the Microsoft Cloud

2. Scripts are available to map to Azure AAD and enable role-based access control (RBAC)

# Core FHIR Capabilities
1. Azure Healthcare APIs FHIR documentation: Includes all FHIR service documentation which has many conceptual, how-to guides, and tutorials that can be leveraged in the open-source as well.

2. Features: This document lists the main features of the Azure Healthcare APIs and the Azure API for FHIR. In general, you can use the features of the Azure Healthcare APIs as a view to the SQL open-source FHIR service and the Azure API for FHIR as a view to the Cosmos DB open-source FHIR server.

3. Authentication: Describes the authentication settings for the FHIR server and how to make use of it in development and test scenarios.

4. Roles: Describes how the FHIR Server for Azure role-based access control (RBAC) system works.

5. Search: Describes how search is implemented for the FHIR Server for Azure.
